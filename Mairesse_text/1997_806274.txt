I feel weird I know I'm about to pull an all nighter and I have this eternal sense of flux but I'm not in anguish at all I'm actually euphoric some how like I said I'm feeling weird that's why I'm doing thins now I don't know really what I'm supposed to say but I guess it doesn't matter well I'm kind of at a stand still I hope you can read all of my word I'm a totally phonetic speller you see I'm dyslexic how ever you spell it well I'll just start talking then things are always weird well nothing is normal it's not suppose to be that would be incredible boring and stagnate but  it's just we never know were we are and never know exactly what we want and even if were some were we never know is this really were I want to be  is this what I want to do I guess it don't matter much were always were  we are and were always how we are entail we change which is normally but different than how I usually am because its different but I'm not indecisive  I think I just question it all and I'm yet to come up with the answer  tired but awake I actually like this and I cant what to participate in the  experiments ( I'm lazy and all I do is procrastinate that's why this  allnighter thing is happening) tired but wanting to do my work I actually get cote up in it when I actually do it I like working but I procrastinate  there's all ways people to talk to and women to hit on and don't get me wrong I just need people my friend and especially the female ones I just need close  people that all is there to be with and together nothing more the one  but any way I get mad at my self for not doing what I need to in school because  I actually like it all I love learning but I just cant put my ass in the  chair and sit once I do I get it done and have fun doing it I still feel weird just lackadaisical and it's one of the few times I feel like reading and  studying even though I do like it when I do it I feel like I'm giving you the  wrong info. just not what your looking for well sorry but it happens  I think I want to do work because my body wants me to sleep and I'm just procrastinating from that like usual its also why I'm taking so long to  do this its not reading its just like me sitting out side talking but I guess its enough and I hope it works for what you want  so  I'll put me always  phrase in here and say good bye   have fun
